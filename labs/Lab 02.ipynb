    "# Week 2 Lab Task\n",
    "This week is about getting started with powerful tools that will underlie many of the skills you learn in the course. Much of the effort is in setting up your programming environment: the lab questions will ensure that it is done correctly and help you grow familiar with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we'll be using the Python programming language, using an innovative environment called Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your _environment_ is similar to your local workspace. Look at your desk: how do you organize your pens, paper, mouse, monitor? Or maybe you have a barebones workspace, working at a coffee shop or kitchen table with only a cup of coffee. In the same way, you can have many different environments for how you work with Python: working on a command line, or running scripts. Jupyter Notebooks is an environment that gives you an interactive, browser based version of Python. It allows you to play with code in a way that gives you immediate feedback, and allows you to break, tinker, and retry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks will be installed through Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "When programming, you're usually not writing everything from scratch. Some code is needed by many other people, so most languages have a concept of a _library_: code written and distributed by other people that you can easily use in your own work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is a scientific distribution of Python, which installs Python on your system alongside a great deal of libraries that scientists use. To be clear: it is possible to install Python in other ways and individually install the libraries, but Anaconda puts it all into a tidy package. As scientists want complicated mathematical algorithms, installing some scientific libraries can be very difficult: Anaconda makes it easy!"

    "Install Jupyter Notebooks following the instructions in the Art of Literary Text Analysis, following the [Getting Setup](https://github.com/sgsinclair/alta/blob/master/ipynb/GettingSetup.ipynb) and [Getting Started](https://github.com/sgsinclair/alta/blob/master/ipynb/GettingStarted.ipynb) (you can stop before the Printing Dynamic Content section). Make sure you install the Python 3 version. Because this is our first introduction to ALTA, it's worth reading the [short introductory text](https://github.com/sgsinclair/alta/blob/master/ipynb/ArtOfLiteraryTextAnalysis.ipynb).
